Gray Wolf
Standing 30 inches tall at the shoulder, gray wolves weigh about 100 pounds. They have long legs that are well adapted to running, allowing them to move fast and travel far in search of food, and large skulls and jaws that are well suited to catching and feeding on large mammals. Wolves also have keen senses of smell, hearing and vision, which they use to detect prey and one another.

Grizzly Bear
Grizzly bears are large and range in color from very light tan (almost white) to dark brown. They have a dished face, short, rounded ears, and a large shoulder hump. The hump is where a mass of muscles attach to the bear's backbone and give the bear additional strength for digging. Large adult grizzlies may be about 8 feet long and weigh about 900 pounds. They are, however, surprisingly agile and can run as fast as 35 miles per hour over short distances.

Lion
Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. A full-grown male is about 6–7 feet long, excluding the 3-foot tail; he stands about 4 feet high at the shoulder and weighs 370–500 pounds. Females are slightly smaller.

Mountain Lion
The mountain lion—also known as the cougar, puma, panther, or catamount—is a large cat species native to the Americas. Mountain lions are large, tan cats. Their bodies are mainly covered in tawny-beige fur, except for the whitish-gray belly and chest. Black markings decorate the tip of the tail, ears, and around the snout. Mountain lions vary hugely in average body size depending on geographic location—their size is smallest closer to the equator and largest closer to the poles.

Common Raccoon
Common Raccoons are stocky animals with short legs and small, rounded ears. Their fur is gray, with dark black markings around their eyes, and black bands on their tail. Their belly and muzzle are lighter colored while the feet are darker gray. Raccoons have coarse, medium-length fur and a very bushy tail. They are between 30 and 36 inches long, including the 10-inch tail. Weight is usually about 22 pounds or less.

Mandrill
The mandrill is stout-bodied and has a short tail, prominent brow ridges, and small, close-set, sunken eyes. The adult male has bare coloured patches of skin on both the face and the buttocks. On the face the cheeks are ribbed and range in colour from bright blue to violet, with scarlet along the bridge and end of the nose. An adult male is about 3 feet long, including the tail stub, and weighs up to 77 pounds.

Polar Bear
Polar bears are the largest carnivorous land mammals on Earth. They are seven to eight feet long, measured from the nose to the tip of their very short tail. Male polar bears are much larger than the females. A large male can weigh more than 1,700 pounds, while a large female is about half that size (up to 1,000 pounds). Bears can weigh about 50 percent more after a successful hunting season than they do at the start of the next; most of this additional weight is accumulated fat. A newborn polar bear weighs only about 1.5 pounds.

Beaver
Beavers are the largest living rodents in North America, with adults averaging 40 pounds in weight and measuring more than 3 feet in length, including the tail. These semi-aquatic mammals have webbed hind feet, large incisor teeth, and a broad, flat tail. Their large, orange incisors grow continuously throughout their lifetime. They have webbed rear feet and digitated front paws. The beaver's stocky body enables it to conserve heat.

Chimpanzee
Chimpanzees are one of our planet's 'great apes', along with gorillas and orangutans. They have long arms that extend below their knees, short legs and black hair covering almost their entire body. Their faces are flat with big eyes, a small nose and a wide mouth. Chimpanzees and humans share approximately 95% of their DNA. They are more closely related to humans than they are to gorillas!

Black Rhinoceros
The black rhinoceros typically weighs between 1,500 and 2,900 pounds; males are the same size as females. It stands 5 feet high at the shoulder and is 11.5 feet long. The black rhinoceros occupies a variety of habitats, including open plains, sparse thorn scrub, savannas, thickets, and dry forests, as well as mountain forests and moorlands at high altitudes. It is a selective browser, and grass plays a minor role in its diet. It uses it's unique looking, pointy upper lip to grasp and pluck food from trees, bushes and shrubs.

Walrus
Walruses are strong bodied and have a very thick, tough hide that can be up to an inch thick. The most distinctive feature of walruses, both male and female, is their two ivory tusks, which are long upper canine teeth that grow throughout their life. Adult males, or bulls, are up 12 feet long and may weigh up to 2 tons; although females are smaller they can weigh more than 1 ton.
1
Arctic Fox
Arctic foxes are well adapted to the cold: They are small and stout compared to other foxes; their short snouts, stubby legs, and little, curled ears help to minimize heat loss. Thick fur combined with a unique circulation system in their paws keep the pads of Arctic foxes' feet warm while maintaining their core temperature. In the winter, these foxes boast a long white coat that sheds to short, dark gray to bluish-brown fur in the summer. They measure three feet from nose to tail and weigh between 6 and 12 pounds.
1
Sugar Glider
Sugar gliders are generally 5 to 12 inches long, with a tail that is 6 to 9 inches long. Their fur is bluish-gray with a pale belly and a dark stripe that runs down the back. Sugar gliders are similar to flying squirrels and have gliding membranes that allow efficient movement. These gliding membranes are called patagiums and stretch from the wrists to the ankles. Sugar gliders can glide up to 164 feet using their tails to steer and balance.
2
Cheetah
Cheetahs have slender, long-legged bodies with blunt, semi-retractable claws. Their heads are small with high-set eyes. A black tear mark runs from the inner corner of each eye down to the mouth. A cheetah's teeth are small when compared with other big cats, which accommodates their larger nasal passages that enable quick air intake. Cheetahs are the fastest land mammal: at top speed, they advance 23 feet in a single stride and complete four strides per second. That top speed averages between 60 and 70 miles per hour.

Blue Whale
Blue whales are blue-gray in colour with lighter gray mottling in the form of large spots, which appear as if they were dabbed on with a huge paintbrush. The lower surfaces of the flippers are lighter gray or white in some instances. It is the most massive animal ever to have lived; on average a blue whale weighs approximately 150 tons and may attain a length of nearly 100 feet. The heart of one blue whale was recorded at nearly 1,500 pounds.
1
Echidna
Echidnas are covered with a fur that can range from reddish to dark brown colour. The spines on the backs of Echidnas are modified hairs that vary in colour from cream to black. Their spines can reach up to 2 inches in length and the proportion of hair to spines varies according to climate. The Echidna’s snout is about 3 inches long and used to poke into rotten logs and termite mounds that have been broken into with its feet.
2
Capybara
Capybaras are short-haired brownish rodents with blunt snouts, short legs, small ears, and almost no tail. They are shy and associate in groups along the banks of lakes and rivers. They normally feed in the morning and evening and spend most of the day resting under cover along the banks. They are vegetarian and in cultivated areas sometimes become pests by eating melons, grain, and squash. They swim and dive readily and commonly enter water to elude predators such as jaguars and anacondas.
2
Sea Otter
The sea otter is the largest member of the weasel family. Their fur is made up of a dense underfur, ranging in color from brown to black, and longer guard hairs. The guard hairs can be brown to black to silver. Their hind feet are webbed to aid in swimming, and their front toes are short and stiff. Adult sea otters may grow up to 5 feet in length. The males weigh 80–100 pounds but can weigh more than 100 pounds. The females are smaller, weighing 50–70 pounds.
3
Hippopotamus
The hippopotamus has a bulky body on stumpy legs, an enormous head, a short tail, and four toes on each foot. Each toe has a nail-like hoof. Males are usually 11.5 feet long, stand 5 feet tall, and weigh 3.5 tons. In terms of physical size, males are the larger sex, weighing roughly 30 percent more than females. The skin is 2 inches thick on the flanks but thinner elsewhere and nearly hairless. Colour is grayish brown, with pinkish underparts. The mouth is 1.6 feet wide and can gape 150° to show the teeth. The lower canines are sharp and may exceed 12 inches.

Pocket Gopher
Pocket gophers are fossorial rodents named for their fur-lined cheek pouches. Their cheek pouches, or pockets, are used for transporting bits of plant food that they gather while foraging underground. They have special adaptations for their burrowing lifestyle, including clawed front paws for digging, small eyes and ears, and sensitive whiskers and tails. They’re also able to close their lips behind their long incisors so they can use their teeth to loosen soil without getting any dirt in their mouths. They range in length from 5 to 14 inches.
